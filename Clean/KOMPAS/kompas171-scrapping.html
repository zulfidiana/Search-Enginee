<title>Coronavirus Symptoms Continue Months after Recovery: UK Study</title>

<top>LONDON, KOMPAS.com – Continued fatigue and breathlessness are some of the  coronavirus symptoms that continue after recovery, according to a small UK study. More than half of  Covid-19 patients discharged from the hospital reported ongoing coronavirus symptoms such as shortness of breath, tiredness, anxiety, and depression for two to three months after their initial infection. </top>

"These findings underscore the need to further explore the physiological processes associated with Covid-19 and to develop a holistic, integrated model of clinical care for our patients after they have been discharged from hospital," said Betty Raman, a doctor at Oxford's Radcliffe Department of Medicine who co-led the research.
