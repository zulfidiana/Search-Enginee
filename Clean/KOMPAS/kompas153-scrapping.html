<title>Pay Later: G20 Extends Debt Relief for Developing Countries</title>

<top>WASHINGTON, KOMPAS.com - The Group of 20 ( G20) nations agreed to extend  debt relief for another six months to support poor nations in their fight against the  coronavirus pandemic. The G20 represents the world’s biggest economies and their decision of extending debt relief to the most vulnerable countries was made on Wednesday. </top>

<middle>The G20 stated that the suspension of debt payments by another half a year could provide debt relief of $14 billion that had been due to expire at the end of 2020. Wednesday’s decision gives developing nations until the end of June 2021 to focus on spending on health care and emergency stimulus programs rather than debt repayments.

International aid groups expressed disappointment that more debt relief isn't being provided to developing countries by extending the moratorium on debt payments for a full year or by forgiving part of the debt rather than merely suspending payments. “This pandemic has laid bare a glaring and unjust double standard: The world's wealthiest countries play by one set of rules, and the world's poorest by another,” said David McNair, Executive Director for Global Policy at ONE, an international aid group. G20 officials argued that the coronavirus-pandemic-induced relief that is being provided is helping 46 of the 73 countries eligible with efforts underway to expand the help. </bottom>
