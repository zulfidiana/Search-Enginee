<title>Germany to Give $662 Million to Holocaust Survivors Struggling during Pandemic</title>

<top>BERLIN, KOMPAS.com -  Germany has set aside $662 million in aid for  Holocaust survivors struggling under the burdens of the  coronavirus pandemic. The New York-based Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, also referred to as the Claims Conference, negotiated the half-billion Euro compensation with the German government. </top>

<middle>The $662 million funding will be distributed among 240,000 Holocaust survivors around the world, primarily in Israel, North America, the former Soviet Union and Western Europe, over the next two years. While 75 years have passed since World War II ended, Holocaust survivors are all elderly and they face immense risks amid the coronavirus pandemic.
