<title>Remdesivir has ‘Little or No Effect' on Covid-19 Mortality: WHO Study</title>

<top>GENEVA, KOMPAS.com – A WHO-backed study found that one of the most promising Covid-19 treatments, remdesivir, does little to prevent coronavirus-related deaths. The remdisivir antiviral drug was part of President Donald Trump’s  Covid-19 treatment when he contracted the deadly virus last month. </top>

<middle>The Covid-19 treatment was one of several reviewed in a large study of more than 11,000 people across 30 countries.

The data, which has yet to be peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal, seems to contradict at least two major US studies that have shown that  remdesivir can reduce the duration of hospital stays for Covid-19 patients. </middle>

No cure yet US President Donald Trump has been talking up an experimental Covid-19 treatment he received as "a cure", but one of his top government scientists said referring to it as such may cause "confusion". Anthony Fauci, the longtime Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Disease, gave an interview to CBS News on Friday where he also referred to the coronavirus outbreak at the White House that infected dozens of people as a "super spreader event". </bottom>
