<title>French Teacher Samuel Paty Beheaded after Prophet Mohammed Cartoon Lesson</title>

<top>BOBIGNY, KOMPAS.com – A  French teacher identified as  Samuel Paty became the victim of a beheading by an 18-year-old that has left France in shock.

As part of a course in civics and morals this month, Samuel Paty showed the class cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed — the most hot-button issue in France since the offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine that published the images was attacked in 2015.

The man published the French teacher's name and the school's address on social media, insisting it was time to "say stop". He also went with his daughter to the police to file a complaint against Paty. According to Anti-Terror Prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard, initial evidence suggests that the perpetrator loitered outside the school on Friday afternoon and asked pupils where he could find the victim. </bottom>
