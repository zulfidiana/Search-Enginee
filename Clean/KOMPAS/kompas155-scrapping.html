<title>No Christmas Cheer as Pandemic Batters Finland’s Rovaniemi Tourism</title>

<top> ROVANIEMI, KOMPAS.com – Although  Christmas is coming,  Finland’s  Rovaniemi is in a shortage of cheer as the  coronavirus pandemic is hitting its tourism sector hard. Rovaniemi is the location of Santa’s home village in northern Finland, but unlike previous years, the flocks of tourists that usually flock the town at this time of year are not there. </top>

Those that manage to pass through the stringent coronavirus travel restrictions can face a two-week quarantine.

In August 2020, foreign tourist numbers were down 78 percent from a year earlier, according to travel industry data from Business Finland. "For local businesses, definitely, Christmas is in danger," said Sanna Karkkainen, managing director of Visit Rovaniemi tourist board. "Christmas itself will come, but how merry it will be, that's the question mark." </bottom>
