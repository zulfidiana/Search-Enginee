<title>IMF: Indonesia Economy to Contract 1.5 Percent Next Year due to Covid-19</title>

<top>JAKARTA, KOMPAS.com – Indonesia's economy could shrink by 1.5 percent, a contraction deeper than the initial projection of 0.3 percent in June, the  International Monetary Fund ( IMF) said. Based on its World Economic Outlook on October 13, the IMF said that the Indonesian economy remains unstable due to the adverse impact of the  Covid-19 pandemic in various sectors. </top>

The economic performance in developed and developing countries, except for China, is projected to remain below the 2019 levels next year. The report said that economic performance in the medium term will remain bleak.The economy is expected to grow slowly about 3.5 percent between 2022 and 2025 as the economy of most countries is predicted to be lower than the pre-pandemic levels. </middle>

This sign of improvement was fueled by the recovery in the US and Europe's economic performance after they have eased Covid-19 lockdown restrictions. The IMF expected the global economy to recover and grow by 5.2 percent next year, while Indonesia’s economy is projected to grow by 6.1 percent.
