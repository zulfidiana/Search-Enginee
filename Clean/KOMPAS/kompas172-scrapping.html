<title>President Jokowi Urges Transparency on Covid-19 Vaccines </title>

<top> JAKARTA, KOMPAS.com – The prospect of protests continued to play on President Joko ‘Jokowi’ Widodo’s mind as the government is set to start Covid-19 vaccinations next November. </top>

<middle>The head of state urged officials to give the information on the vaccine correctly and transparently before it is carried out. “The last thing we need is the public rejecting [the vaccine] because of disinformation and inefficient dissemination of facts,” Jokowi warned during a cabinet meeting at the Presidential Palace on Monday, October 19.

He added that State Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir will deal with the former, while Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto will deal with the latter. Jokowi reminded his cabinet not to be hasty in communicating the government’s policy, as doing so will reprise the chaos surrounding the Jobs Creation Omnibus Law. “We need to be mindful about sensitive aspects of the vaccine, such as whether it is halal, its costs and distribution,” he said. The government projected that 160 million Indonesians will receive the Covid-19 vaccine in 2021 They include 86 million recipients of the Health Care and Social Security Agency or BPJS who are entitled to free vaccinations. </bottom>
